# Small-USB-HID-Keyboard
Small 64 key USB qwerty keyboard with tactile keys wired in an 8x8 matrix using Sparkfun pro-micro ATmega32U4 

I have designed this keyboard for a Raspberry Pi "cyberdeck" / field PC project.
Arduino code and Eagle files attached.

The keyboard footprint fits a pelican style waterproof case from Supercheap Auto:
